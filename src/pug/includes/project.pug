            .col-lg-10.col-md-12
                p <em>Antibiotic resistance</em> poses a major threat to global health. Through the use and misuse of antibiotics, many pathogenic bacteria have evolved a resistance against them. Consequently, today there are many diseases for which no effective antibiotics exist. This leads to increased mortality rates and higher medical costs worldwide.

                h5 Our idea
            .col-lg-10.col-md-12 
                p A possible alternative to antibiotics are <em>antimicrobial peptides</em>, short AMPs. These naturally occur in humans, other animals and plants as a part of the innate immune response. AMPs are short proteins, which can act against bacteria, viruses, fungi and even cancer cells. They function by targeting the bacteria’s cell membrane, as well as multiple other targets. Additionally, many AMPs act by stimulating an immune response. Because of this mode of action, resistances against AMPs are less likely to occur than against antibiotics. However, most AMPs are relatively unstable limiting their therapeutic application.
                p In our project, we want to develop a <em>fast expression and testing platform for stabilized AMPs</em>, grafted into cyclotide scaffolds.

                h5 Cyclotides 
            .col-lg-10.col-md-12 
                p Cyclotides are cyclic peptides with a knotted structure formed by three disulfide bonds. This structure is responsible for their high stability towards heat, chemicals and proteases. The amino acid sequences in between the cyclotide’s cysteine residues are called loops. These are highly variable in sequence and can be replaced with other peptides to <em>combine bioactivity</em> of these peptides <em>and stability</em> of the cyclotide.
                p As an example, we want to graft the peptide KR-12, which is the antibacterial fragment of the human AMP cathelicidin. KR-12 will be grafted one or multiple times into different loops of the cyclotide McoTI-II. This cyclotide does not possess any antibacterial activity by itself. Therefore, the success of the different grafting approaches can be observed.

                        p At first, we design different grafted cyclotide constructs. Their structure is <em>modeled</em> to make a theoretical prediction about their fold and conservation of the AMP’s bioactivity.

                    .col.mb-2
                        p The designed sequences are then complemented to ensure their correct expression in plants later on in the project. <em>Molecular cloning</em> techniques in Escherichia coli are used to finally yield an expression vector. Besides the cyclotide sequence, this vector also contains a sequence encoding an enzyme needed for cyclotide maturation in plants (AEP).

                        p Next, <em>Agrobacterium</em> is transformed with the expression vector. Agrobacteria are plant pathogens and are commonly used in biotechnology to insert DNA vectors into plant cells.

                    .col.mb-2
                        p To express the grafted cyclotides, leafs of <em>Nicotiana benthamiana</em> (tobacco) plants are infiltrated with the transformed agrobacteria. Agrobacteria are infecting the plant cells with the expression vector, thereby equipping plant cells with the genetic blueprint to express the potential cyclotide peptides. Success of the infiltration can be observed by a co-expressed fluorescent reporter gene.

                        p The expressed grafted cyclotides are <em>isolated and purified</em> from tobacco leafs and used for further characterization experiments.

                    .col.mb-2
                        p Finally, to test the antibacterial properties of the grafted AMPs, <em>activity tests</em> are performed. This is done with both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. We are also collaborating with other iGEM teams to test our obtained constructs on different bacterial strains. Additionally, structure and mode of action of the antibacterial peptides can be predicted with <em>molecular dynamics modeling</em>.
